Playlists have a chance of being inappropriate, outdated and no longer relevant and providing admins the ability to manage them will improve overall relevance.","This component is located within the Moderation section of the Admin Portal under “Manage Public Playlists”. ","Admins will see a list of public playlists relevant for their territory or will see all playlists the user is a Global Admin. This lists default sort order will be date modified newest to oldest."," ","Admins may use the search bar to find a playlist by owner name or playlist title.  They may alternatively use the sortable author, title, date modified, or date created fields. Note that from the ‘Managing public playlists’ page, the admin can check the box to only view inactive users to reassign playlists of former employees."," ","Admins can click directly on the ‘Reassign’ or ‘Make private’ buttons to continue with the prescribed action.  Admins can also first click on any individual playlist to open a modal to get more details about it before acting.  From within this modal they can see the playlist’s description, a list of learning objects within the playlist, author name, territory, and # of subscribers. ","Clicking the ‘Reassign’ button will open an initial modal to search for a new owner.  Admins may search for the learner by User Guid or User ID.  The admin can review the details of that user before proceeding to click “Next”.","On the proceeding page they can compare the previous and new owner before clicking “Reassign” to complete the action.  ","Subscribers to reassigned playlists will continue to see the playlist on their “Subscribed playlist” page.  The previous owner will no longer see the playlist on their “Your playlists” page.","Clicking the ‘Make private’ button will open a modal making sure the admin is certain that they want to complete the action of changing the playlist from public to private.  Once changed the playlist will no longer show in the list.  Owners will be notified by an in-app notification that their playlist has been made private. ","Subscribers will maintain access to playlists that have been made private by the admin.  These playlists will  no longer be discoverable on the “Discover” playlist page."," ","In conjunction with these playlist enhancements, we have also removed the maximum of 25 or your own playlists.  Twenty-four (24) will display by default, with subsequent loaded when triggered by infinite scroll. We have also added a filter drawer to both “Your playlists” and “Subscribed playlists” and will allow for search by title.  The filter drawer will default to open to large screens and to closed for anything smaller. The original default to sorting by title A-Z has been updated to Latest Activity new to old.  Along with this change a sort by for both “Latest activity” and “Title” has been added."]],"4":[["CR151 Playlist Administration"]],"id":"13"})
